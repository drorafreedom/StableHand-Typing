1.	The therapy page starts with animation multifunction the default and is empty always. 
2.	The ending animation only baseline is updated.
3.	Typed text information needs to be captured at the beginning of the typing and at the end of the typing (can change after and is logged) 

4.	need to have a pop up at the end of the typing to inform the patient. 0 after submitting, would you like to know your scores yes - your score is % accuracy (not error as it is discouraging)

5.	preset load from any other modules across the animation type ( not true , I jsut recheck )  and across users.  9Not true )  is ok  oh wow. 
6.	Still, we need session ID.
